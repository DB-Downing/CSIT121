                    <p>Hi! My name is Derrick Boone Downing, and this is my first blog built from scratch! I had some experience
                    building a website, but that was half a decade ago and I need to brush up on my skills and do something new in the process.
                    Learning HTML again after all these years is as easy as I remember and I can't wait to advance my skills even more!</p>

                    <h3>Here are some of the things I've learned so far</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li>How to use VS Code</li>
                        <li>How to create an ordered and unordered list</li>
                        <li>Creating hyperlinks</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>Here are some blogs and coding pages I used to build this website:</p>
