            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>
                 Hi! My name is Derrick, ever since I first laid my hands and eyes on a computer, I've been
                 almost obsessed with them. I love to learn about how they work, and how to make them do what I want.
                 My dream is to work in IT and hopefully work and fix computers for a living. I also spend a lot of
                time playing games or working out, with all this freetime outside of college, I try to stay active and healthy.

            <h2>Education</h2>
            <p>
                I'm currently a student at the Community College of Baltimore County, studying Information Technology. Originally
                I was aiming for computer engineering, but I found that the IT field suited me better. I plan to transfer to a 4 year university
                after I finish my associates degree here at CCBC.

            <h2>Skills/Hobbies</h2>
            <p>

                I'm an artist but recently I've been slacking off on that hobby and put more time into going to the gym and working out.
                Besides working out, I try to put myself out there and make plans with friends, while also keeping myself entertained with
                games.
