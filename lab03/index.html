            <p>Hi! My name is Derrick Boone Downing, and this is my first blog built from scratch! I had some
                experience building a website before, but that was nearly half a decade ago! I need to brush up
                on my skills and create something new in the process. Relearning HTML again after all these years
                was like reading a book I loved as a kid. It is as easy as I remember and I can't wait to advance my
                skills even more! The only thing that is different is that I'm diving more indepth into website making
                and utilizing CSS in a more practical manner.</p>
            <div id="general">
                <h3>Here are some of the things I've learned so far:</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><b>How to use VS Code</b></li>
                    <li><b>How to create an ordered and unordered list</b></li>
                    <li><b>Creating hyperlinks</b></li>
                </ul>
                <p>Here are some blogs and coding pages I used to build this website:</p>
