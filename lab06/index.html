        <h3>What is the URL of the website?</h3>
        <p><a
                href="https://www.burkemuseum.org/collections-and-research/biology/herpetology/all-about-amphibians/all-about-frogs">Burk
                Museum</a>
        </p>

        <h3>What is the name of the website? </h3>
        <p>All About Frogs</p>

        <h3>Who is the site's target audience? </h3>
        <p>People who are learning about frogs and what
            makes them unique compared to toads. This
            paired with other facts and commomly asked
            questions about frogs gives the audience insight about that creature.</p>

        <h3>How is the site organized?</h3>
        <p>The site is a Hierarchical Organization, with the page in question being a subcatagory/page
            in relation to the home. This page has its contents in a more centered format, meaning all of
            the information is read down the middle of the page with the text alligned to the left. It
            makes the page have a cleaner look while also making it easily transferable to a mobile format,
            while also making it easy to read. The navigation bar is always present when scrolling so the
            user can access other pages without having to scroll back to the top of the page.</p>

        <h3>Which "CRAP" Design Principle does
            the use? Provide at least one example.</h3>
        <p>The CRAP Design Principle that this site utilizes is the Repitition and Contrast aspect due to the text
            being centered on the page and the allignment of it shifted to the left. As for the Contrast, the font
            size of the headings are consistant, along with the smaller font size present in the bodys. </p>

        <h3>What is the Audit Score according to
            the Accessibility Checker?</h3>
        <p>According to the Audit Score on the Accessibility Checker, the site has a score of 17%, with 14 Critical
            Issues and 34 Not Applicables.</p>
        <aside>
            <div class="image-container">
                <img src="critique1.png" alt="Critique on the webpage" class="image">
                <img src="critique2.png" alt="Critique on the webpage" class="image">
            </div>
            <img src="critique3.png" alt="Critique on the webpages source code" class="image-large">
        </aside>

        <h3>What is the site's effectiveness?
            Does it support users in completing
            actions accurately?</h3>
        <p>When it comes to site effectiveness, it is easy to scroll and read the information, but for navigation,
            it lacks in being clear. I originally found this site on Google linking to this section of the webpage,
            but after trying to navigate to the "All About Frogs" section from the home, I was easily lost. It wasn't
            too clear as
            to how one can travel from page to page and the only way I got back was through the "Back" part of the
            browser.
        </p>

        <h3>What is the site's efficiency?
            Can users can perform tasks quickly?</h3>
        <p>As for performing tasks, it's easy top switch to a different page since the navagation bar stays at the top
            of the page
            regardles of how far one scrolls. The only caveat is that this navigation bar is for the main webpage "Burke
            Museum"
            instead of the section of the page I was on "All About Frogs." That part of the page navigation was only
            accessible to
            the top of the page and didn't follow the user when scrolling.
        </p>

        <h3>How is the engagement? Is it pleasant
            to use and appropriate for its industry/topic?</h3>
        <p>The information is simple and to the point, the headers are more common questions people ask about frogs
            rather than
            facts or important aspects to learn about them. It's more surface level rather than more indepth topics, for
            a page
            titled "All About Frogs" it doesn't exactly deliver in terms of fact.</p>

        <h3>Make at least one recommendation to improve
            this website based on what you learned in
            this module.</h3>
        <p>Make the website more accessible for people who are disabled like labeling graphics and giving descriptions
            to images.
            Make the information more indepth instead of making the headers of each paragragh questions people commonly
            ask if they
            had zero knowledge about the animal to begin with. The topics coveredf could have been done in one or two
            paragraphs,
            and the rest facts about their diet, habitat, anatomy, species count, ect.</p>
