                <p>Hi! My name is Derrick Boone Downing, and this is my first blog built from scratch! I had some
                    experience building a website before, but that was nearly half a decade ago! I need to brush up
                    on my skills and create something new in the process. Relearning HTML again after all these years
                    was like reading a book I loved as a kid. It is as easy as I remember and I can't wait to advance my
                    skills even more! The only thing that is different is that I'm diving more indepth into website
                    making
                    and utilizing CSS in a more practical manner.</p>

                <p>This lab was the most enjoyable thus far out of the last two completed, for this is where I was
                    finally
                    giving my brain a refresher on the fundamentals of CSS. I became familiar with adding color to
                    backgrounds,
                    to the text, and to borders; and also to alter the size, shape, transparency, and layout of said
                    borders
                    in question. Getting familiar with it allowed me to create a more stylized and personalized
                    appearance to
                    my page.
                    <br>After a while, it does get a little cluttered and absurd with the colors, but that's the beauty
                    of learning
                    any skill, especially if you are relearning it. Mistakes and excess are part of the process; it’s
                    how you
                    figure out what works and what doesn’t. I found myself experimenting with combinations that didn’t
                    make sense visually,
                    but they helped me understand how each property interacts with the others. I also began to
                    appreciate how slight variations
                    in spacing or contrast could dramatically alter the aesthetic. Overall the lab was a great
                    reintroducion to CSS
                </p>

                <p>Working with CSS Grid has been a game changer for my layout skills, but also quite difficult in some
                    areas. I'm used
                    to working with only one set of dimensions for one type of screen, so making a layout that works
                    across different
                    devices has been a challenge. However, I've learned that CSS Grids allows for a lot of flexibility
                    and control over
                    where some of the key elements of my webpage go.
                    <br>Previously, I had an issue with positioning my footer and navigation bar correctly, but now I
                    can seamlessly
                    create areas and manage where they are positioned without necessarily having to touch the original
                    HTML or creating
                    too many IDs and classes. Speaking of media queries, I still haven't implemented them to the full,
                    and I still
                    struggle to know the best way to make my layout responsive. I get the principle behind the use of
                    media queries
                    but still perfecting the use to make the site display nicely on mobile and on desktop.
                    <br>Still, I’m beginning to see how powerful it is to design with adaptability in mind, it’s like
                    building a
                    site that can breathe. Each time I test a new screen size, I learn something new about how users
                    might experience
                    my content. It’s a slow process, but one that’s teaching me to think like both a developer and a
                    designer.
