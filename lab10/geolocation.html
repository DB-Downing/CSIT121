        <p>Geolocation is a technology by which one can trace the exact geographic location of something or someone
            using an electronic smart device, for example,
            a smartphone or computer. Examples of how one can trace or locate themselves or others using geolocation
            include satellite navigation, Wi-Fi points,
            cell towers, or IP addresses—this is but just a few examples out of many ways in which one can trace or
            locate themselves or others using geolocation
            technology. Geolocation technology is indeed one of the most amazing technologies ever invented, as almost
            every mobile app uses geolocation technology.
            Almost 80% of mobile apps today are using geolocation technology.
        </p>
        <p>To pinpoint where you are, geolocation usually integrates data from various sources to achieve the highest
            degree of accuracy. GPS remains the most popular
            and accurate way to locate yourself, since it uses satellite technologies to obtain and relay data. Other
            alternatives include IP-geolocation, where it
            estimates the approximate location of an object using its network data, cell tower triangulation, where your
            location is calculated using various signals
            from cell towers in proximity to your device, and Wi-fi positioning, which relies on radio waves emitted by
            nearby Wi-fi routers to achieve location data.

            Geolocation can therefore be said to essentially involve the technology needed to locate the actual
            whereabouts of a device. Geolocation basically converts satellite, cell tower, or wireless network signals
            into geographic locations. The essence of turning data into geography essentially stands as a layer for
            context to digital information. Geolocation essentially serves to answer one question: where.
